Python is used for programming

The main task of the assignmwnt is to rplay the aiplay function which plays random move into something which uses minmax algorithm and chose the optimal move inorder to win the game.
The alfaminmax.py program contains the min max algorithm whit alpha beta pruning. The program contains the implementation of the minmax algorithm according to the connect 4 game. the program contains various algorithm related functions plus a function which search for the number of available moves, a function which choses the best move from the available move in order to win the game.

one move mode:
In the same directory where the program is present an input1.txt file should be present. 
python maxconnect4.py one-move <input1.txt> <output1.txt> <depth>

iterative mode:
in the same directory where the program is present an input1.txt file should be present. 
python maxconnect4.py interactive <input1.txt> [computer-next/human-next] <depth>
